# CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP

## Overview

The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC 6 MCUs. It comes with a Murata LBEE5KL1DX module, based on the CYW4343W combo device, industry-leading CapSense for touch buttons and slider, on-board debugger/programmer with KitProg3, microSD card interface, 512-Mb Quad-SPI NOR flash, PDM-PCM microphone, and a thermistor. This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing the user to separate the different components and features that come with this kit and use independently. In addition, support for Digilent's Pmod interface is also provided with this kit.
